The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.  Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business,  he asserted. Beasley added,  You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.

Unfurling a mass of yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the 2014 movement that blocked major roads in the financial hub for close to three months, the demonstrators gathered at the same spot where police fired tear gas on the crowds three years ago. The 2014 Hong Kong protests were considered one of the boldest populist challenges to China s Communist Party rulers since the 1989 pro-democracy protests in and around Beijing s Tiananmen Square.  We have no fear,  the protesters shouted as police looked on.  We want universal suffrage.  The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy under a so-called  one country, two systems  arrangement. But frustration over China s tightening grip on Hong Kong s civil liberties was a key factor fuelling the 2014 movement, which was forcibly disbanded by police with no concessions granted by Hong Kong or Chinese authorities. Three years on, many of the youth-led movement s leaders are either behind bars or bracing for jail time on charges such as unlawful assembly.  We need to adjust our mentality,  said Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and one of the leaders of the 2014 protests.  We re not scared. If you want to throw us in prison, do it!  Joshua Wong, aged 17 when he helped lead the movement, and now in jail for unlawful assembly, said Hong Kong was becoming increasingly suppressed, with an estimated 100 activists, most of them young, embroiled in legal proceedings.  As Hong Kong ushers in a heightened authoritarian era, to advocate human rights is to risk becoming a political detainee. This is the new normal,  Wong wrote in a column published in the Guardian newspaper on Thursday.  One simply cannot turn a blind eye and kid oneself that Hong Kong is still the same as it has always been.  An appeals court decision last month to overrule a previous non-jail term and instead imprison Wong and two prominent student activists sparked an international outcry. China s main representative  Liaison  office in Hong Kong couldn t be reached for comment, but Beijing has long stated it respects Hong Kong s  high degree of autonomy  and is supportive of lawful and gradual democratic development until universal suffrage is realized. Political tension has also escalated over posters on university campuses advocating independence for Hong Kong, angering Chinese officials who consider the territory an  inalienable  part of China, and sparking heated standoffs between students and pro-Beijing supporters. \",\n          \"SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Curbing North Korea s nuclear ambitions will top South Korean President Moon Jae-in s agenda in Beijing during a visit this week aimed at breaking the ice after a furious row over Seoul s deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system. While both South Korea and China share the goal of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this. China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tension with North Korea. At his third meeting this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea s agreement with China in late October that they would normalise exchanges and move past the dispute over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two. The THAAD disagreement had dented South Korea s economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were cancelled. While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea s decision to deploy it. In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD s presence was inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.  South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China s security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,  Moon said. Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have  good results  if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiating table, he added. North Korea has shown little sign it wants to engage in formal talks, with its state media citing leader Kim Jong Un as saying on Tuesday North Korea should develop and manufacture more diverse weapons to  completely overpower the enemy . Kim was addressing a rare munitions conference on Monday to laud the North s latest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea last month test-launched what it called its most advanced ICBM in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it presses on with its mission to create a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the United States.  Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have  friendly cooperation  with China, and China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula. During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses taking part in the four-day visit. \",\n          \"(Reuters) - The wife of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday apologized for sniping at a critic on social media site Instagram who called her \\u201cdeplorable\\u201d for a post highlighting her expensive clothing as she exited a government plane. The flap erupted after Mnuchin\\u2019s wife, Scottish-born actress Louise Linton, posted a photo of herself emerging from the aircraft wearing a white outfit and sunglasses, using the hashtags \\u201c#tomford,\\u201d \\u201c#hermesscarf\\u201d and \\u201c#valentino,\\u201d according to images of the Monday evening post on social media. In her initially vitriolic response to the \\u201cdeplorable\\u201d criticism, Linton had lashed out about how much she and her husband contribute to the economy and pay in taxes.  On Tuesday, she scrolled back. \\u201cI apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive,\\u201d Linton said in a statement released through a publicist. Linton has since made her Instagram account private. Jenni Miller, who identified herself as a mother of three from Portland, Oregon, had said of Linton\\u2019s original post on Instagram: \\u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable.\\u201d  Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during her unsuccessful presidential run that some of U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s supporters were a \\u201cbasket of deplorables.\\u201d Linton shot back at Miller. \\u201cDo you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol,\\u201d she said, according to images of the response posted online. \\u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I\\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \\u2018trip\\u2019 than you did.\\u201d The U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. The high-end fashions Linton called out in her post carry hefty price tags, with Hermes scarves retailing from $300 to more than $2,300. Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive and Hollywood film financier. Linton has been at the center of controversy before. Last year she withdrew a self-published book in which she claimed to have been caught up in violence in Zambia. African leaders and aid workers said the book was filled with factual errors. Trump ran on a populist campaign platform, vowing to improve the lives of working Americans and has surrounded himself with a cabinet heavy on corporate titans, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), and financier Wilbur Ross, now the commerce secretary. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83678,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Won, Now What? 18 Shares\\n17 0 0 1 (Donald Trump speaking at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland. Credit: Gage Skidmore / flickr)\\nTrump's victory was a shock to most, especially given the broad support Hillary Clinton received from the forces of Wall Street. Although Trump is a billionaire himself, his criticism of free trade agreements and US policy toward Russia angered a broad section of the ruling class. It is the ruling class in control of the banks, military institutions, and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the United States. Trump's victory is a product of the ruling system's decline and crisis more than anything else. The question is, now what?\\nWhat is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the Trump moment. First, Trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis. The laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite. Technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the US, creating the deindustrialized terrain Trump spoke so much about in his campaign. At the end of the day, the profits that Wall Street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades .\\nSo when Hillary Clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism, few listened. Many people in the US saw Clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground. The Black Lives Matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the Black prisoner population during her husband's rule. Hillary Clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating Trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power.\\nSome have claimed that since Clinton won the popular vote, she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws. Others have argued that the Republican Party right-wing elites rigged the election . However true, there will be no recall this time around. Why? The DNC and the Clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat Sanders. In a stunning shift of political legitimacy, the Democratic Party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its Republican Party counterparts.\\nNumerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet Trump will select. Indeed, Trump\\u2019s possibilities do not deviate from the standard Republican Party makeup. His potential choices for top positions include \\\"tough on crime\\\" Rudy Giuliani, austerity magnate Chris Christie, and privatization enthusiast Newt Gingrich. However, for the first time in a long time, the President of the United States is accountable to something other than the ruling class. In the past, Republican Party and Democratic Party Presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized.\\nMORE...

Just a month ago, Trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class . It was Trump's petty bourgeois and working class base of white America that propelled him to victory. It is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel Trump to choose a neo-con Administration. But a neo-con agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against. Even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white American nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity. However, nothing less can be expected from the likes of Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.\\nThe contradictions of the Trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the Great Depression. White liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the two-party system. The neo-con establishment will have to confront Trump's foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric, much of which is in direct antagonism with the GOP's record. And the Democratic Party will attempt to use the age of Trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp.\\nHow should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions? First, the anti-war left needs to confront Trump's foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back NATO and its escalation toward Russia. The left needs to resist any and all attempts by Trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals, such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the US nuclear arsenal. Of course, Trump\\u2019s rhetoric must be placed in its proper context. It was the Obama Administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to \\\"modernize\\\" the US nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years, a number unseen in US history. This means resistance to the Trump Administration's use of the apparatus that Obama and the Democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class, not just one of the two parties that represent it.\\nThe vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the two-party system. As Don Debar of CPR News has made clear, the check of white supremacy simply doesn't pay the same dividends anymore. While the wealth gap between White America and Black American would take over two centuries to even out , it is also true that merely ten percent White America owns almost all wealth in the US . Capitalism's crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions. A unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the US and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it.\\nWhat is meant by \\u201copportunity\\u201d is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results. It should be imperative that the left force Trump's hand on foreign policy. It should demand that Trump use his executive powers to force through a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the US. The left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his Administration, with full recognition that it was Democratic and Republican Party consensus that got us here. As emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the United States, the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before Trump: class war.\",\n          \"Honduran electoral website shows president 1.59 percent points ahead TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez held a lead over his main opposition rival after a partial recount of a disputed Nov. 26 presidential vote that has sparked a political crisis, the website of the electoral tribunal showed Monday. Hernandez had 42.98 percent of the vote, while TV star Salvador Nasralla had 41.39 percent, with 99.96 percent of votes tallied, according to the tribunal s website. The head of the tribunal, David Matamoros, has yet to declare an outright winner, telling reporters that parties could still file legal challenges and that the tribunal could still consider a wider recount. He said there would be more announcements later on Monday. Early last week, Nasralla, a former sportscaster and game show host, appeared set for an upset victory over Hernandez, gaining a five point lead with over half of the vote tallied. After the count suddenly halted for more than a day, the sporadic vote count started leaning in favor of the incumbent. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83306,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"boiler room ep pharmacolog nightmar tune altern current radio network acr anoth live broadcast boiler room start pm pst pm est everi wednesday join us uncensor uninterrupt talk radio custom made barfli philosoph misguid moralist masochist street corner evangelist media maniac savant polit anim otherwis lovabl rascal join acr host hesher spore along randi j wire daniel spauld soul east tonight boiler gang bring rant rave medic industri assault mind member western societi pitfal western educ aka indoctrin poison food suppli water suppli air ground mental wellb also touchi convers regard privileg racial intellectu locat sexual smokescreen ident polit want particip bring someth interest throw boiler join us altern current radio chat room boiler room not polict correct zone listen show player enjoy refer link\",\n          \"conserv gay guy blast penc aspen neighbor hang make america gay banner front hous said good fenc make good neighbor aspen colo week vice presid mike penc someth differ post vacat lodg peopl next door specif rainbow banner read make america gay appear stone pillar front hous penc wife stay week vp mike penc stay hous near aspen vacat neighbor color messag http co ldef h g u via jasonausland pic twitter com pzwqmn iml aspen time theaspentim decemb daughter coupl across street one girlfriend reportedli drape rainbow banner pillar pitkin counti deputi secret servic member stood nearbi aspen time report stone pillar situat end driveway two home accord time secret servic agent unfaz women drape banner pillar tell not control free speech right fox news conserv gay guy express disgust peopl place make america gay banner across penc famili vacat retreat tweet may gay tire crap life revolv around sexual person first call toler left continu caus divis countri mike penc neighbor aspen hung make america gay banner may gay tire crap life revolv around sexual person first call toler left continu caus divis countri conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb conserv gay guy not afraid call liber gay intoler also not afraid call liber friend hypocrisi none conserv famili member friend turn back came gay howev friend becam social justic warrior stop friend polit view side claim toler compassion realli conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb muslim feminst lol activist linda sarsour tweet support sharia law conserv gay guy destroy respons know live sharia law suddenli loan credit card becom interest free sound nice linda sarsour lsarsour may know thrown build gay http co bxrebboplb conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb conserv gay guy hit nail head illeg immigr analog half famili bought ticket disneyland half snuck would break famili kick one snuck half paid allow leav pleas take free educ go back countri know fix conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Unfurling a mass of yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the 2014 movement that blocked major roads in the financial hub for close to three months, the demonstrators gathered at the same spot where police fired tear gas on the crowds three years ago. The 2014 Hong Kong protests were considered one of the boldest populist challenges to China s Communist Party rulers since the 1989 pro-democracy protests in and around Beijing s Tiananmen Square.  We have no fear,  the protesters shouted as police looked on.  We want universal suffrage.  The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy under a so-called  one country, two systems  arrangement. But frustration over China s tightening grip on Hong Kong s civil liberties was a key factor fuelling the 2014 movement, which was forcibly disbanded by police with no concessions granted by Hong Kong or Chinese authorities. Three years on, many of the youth-led movement s leaders are either behind bars or bracing for jail time on charges such as unlawful assembly.  We need to adjust our mentality,  said Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and one of the leaders of the 2014 protests.  We re not scared. If you want to throw us in prison, do it!  Joshua Wong, aged 17 when he helped lead the movement, and now in jail for unlawful assembly, said Hong Kong was becoming increasingly suppressed, with an estimated 100 activists, most of them young, embroiled in legal proceedings.  As Hong Kong ushers in a heightened authoritarian era, to advocate human rights is to risk becoming a political detainee. This is the new normal,  Wong wrote in a column published in the Guardian newspaper on Thursday.  One simply cannot turn a blind eye and kid oneself that Hong Kong is still the same as it has always been.  An appeals court decision last month to overrule a previous non-jail term and instead imprison Wong and two prominent student activists sparked an international outcry. China s main representative  Liaison  office in Hong Kong couldn t be reached for comment, but Beijing has long stated it respects Hong Kong s  high degree of autonomy  and is supportive of lawful and gradual democratic development until universal suffrage is realized. Political tension has also escalated over posters on university campuses advocating independence for Hong Kong, angering Chinese officials who consider the territory an  inalienable  part of China, and sparking heated standoffs between students and pro-Beijing supporters. \",\n          \"SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Curbing North Korea s nuclear ambitions will top South Korean President Moon Jae-in s agenda in Beijing during a visit this week aimed at breaking the ice after a furious row over Seoul s deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system. While both South Korea and China share the goal of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this. China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tension with North Korea. At his third meeting this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea s agreement with China in late October that they would normalise exchanges and move past the dispute over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two. The THAAD disagreement had dented South Korea s economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were cancelled. While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea s decision to deploy it. In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD s presence was inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.  South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China s security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,  Moon said. Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have  good results  if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiating table, he added. North Korea has shown little sign it wants to engage in formal talks, with its state media citing leader Kim Jong Un as saying on Tuesday North Korea should develop and manufacture more diverse weapons to  completely overpower the enemy . Kim was addressing a rare munitions conference on Monday to laud the North s latest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korea last month test-launched what it called its most advanced ICBM in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it presses on with its mission to create a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the United States.  Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have  friendly cooperation  with China, and China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula. During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses taking part in the four-day visit. \",\n          \"(Reuters) - The wife of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday apologized for sniping at a critic on social media site Instagram who called her \\u201cdeplorable\\u201d for a post highlighting her expensive clothing as she exited a government plane. The flap erupted after Mnuchin\\u2019s wife, Scottish-born actress Louise Linton, posted a photo of herself emerging from the aircraft wearing a white outfit and sunglasses, using the hashtags \\u201c#tomford,\\u201d \\u201c#hermesscarf\\u201d and \\u201c#valentino,\\u201d according to images of the Monday evening post on social media. In her initially vitriolic response to the \\u201cdeplorable\\u201d criticism, Linton had lashed out about how much she and her husband contribute to the economy and pay in taxes.  On Tuesday, she scrolled back. \\u201cI apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive,\\u201d Linton said in a statement released through a publicist. Linton has since made her Instagram account private. Jenni Miller, who identified herself as a mother of three from Portland, Oregon, had said of Linton\\u2019s original post on Instagram: \\u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable.\\u201d  Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during her unsuccessful presidential run that some of U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s supporters were a \\u201cbasket of deplorables.\\u201d Linton shot back at Miller. \\u201cDo you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol,\\u201d she said, according to images of the response posted online. \\u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I\\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \\u2018trip\\u2019 than you did.\\u201d The U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. The high-end fashions Linton called out in her post carry hefty price tags, with Hermes scarves retailing from $300 to more than $2,300. Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive and Hollywood film financier. Linton has been at the center of controversy before. Last year she withdrew a self-published book in which she claimed to have been caught up in violence in Zambia. African leaders and aid workers said the book was filled with factual errors. Trump ran on a populist campaign platform, vowing to improve the lives of working Americans and has surrounded himself with a cabinet heavy on corporate titans, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), and financier Wilbur Ross, now the commerce secretary. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83678,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Won, Now What? 18 Shares\\n17 0 0 1 (Donald Trump speaking at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland. Credit: Gage Skidmore / flickr)\\nTrump's victory was a shock to most, especially given the broad support Hillary Clinton received from the forces of Wall Street. Although Trump is a billionaire himself, his criticism of free trade agreements and US policy toward Russia angered a broad section of the ruling class. It is the ruling class in control of the banks, military institutions, and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the United States. Trump's victory is a product of the ruling system's decline and crisis more than anything else. The question is, now what?\\nWhat is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the Trump moment. First, Trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis. The laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite. Technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the US, creating the deindustrialized terrain Trump spoke so much about in his campaign. At the end of the day, the profits that Wall Street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades .\\nSo when Hillary Clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism, few listened. Many people in the US saw Clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground. The Black Lives Matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the Black prisoner population during her husband's rule. Hillary Clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating Trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power.\\nSome have claimed that since Clinton won the popular vote, she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws. Others have argued that the Republican Party right-wing elites rigged the election . However true, there will be no recall this time around. Why? The DNC and the Clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat Sanders. In a stunning shift of political legitimacy, the Democratic Party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its Republican Party counterparts.\\nNumerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet Trump will select. Indeed, Trump\\u2019s possibilities do not deviate from the standard Republican Party makeup. His potential choices for top positions include \\\"tough on crime\\\" Rudy Giuliani, austerity magnate Chris Christie, and privatization enthusiast Newt Gingrich. However, for the first time in a long time, the President of the United States is accountable to something other than the ruling class. In the past, Republican Party and Democratic Party Presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized.\\nMORE... Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Brian Cloughley: \\u201cThe Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and China\\u201d Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it) This is not the case with Trump. Just a month ago, Trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class . It was Trump's petty bourgeois and working class base of white America that propelled him to victory. It is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel Trump to choose a neo-con Administration. But a neo-con agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against. Even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white American nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity. However, nothing less can be expected from the likes of Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.\\nThe contradictions of the Trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the Great Depression. White liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the two-party system. The neo-con establishment will have to confront Trump's foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric, much of which is in direct antagonism with the GOP's record. And the Democratic Party will attempt to use the age of Trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp.\\nHow should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions? First, the anti-war left needs to confront Trump's foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back NATO and its escalation toward Russia. The left needs to resist any and all attempts by Trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals, such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the US nuclear arsenal. Of course, Trump\\u2019s rhetoric must be placed in its proper context. It was the Obama Administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to \\\"modernize\\\" the US nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years, a number unseen in US history. This means resistance to the Trump Administration's use of the apparatus that Obama and the Democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class, not just one of the two parties that represent it.\\nThe vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the two-party system. As Don Debar of CPR News has made clear, the check of white supremacy simply doesn't pay the same dividends anymore. While the wealth gap between White America and Black American would take over two centuries to even out , it is also true that merely ten percent White America owns almost all wealth in the US . Capitalism's crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions. A unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the US and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it.\\nWhat is meant by \\u201copportunity\\u201d is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results. It should be imperative that the left force Trump's hand on foreign policy. It should demand that Trump use his executive powers to force through a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the US. The left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his Administration, with full recognition that it was Democratic and Republican Party consensus that got us here. As emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the United States, the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before Trump: class war.\",\n          \"Honduran electoral website shows president 1.59 percent points ahead TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez held a lead over his main opposition rival after a partial recount of a disputed Nov. 26 presidential vote that has sparked a political crisis, the website of the electoral tribunal showed Monday. Hernandez had 42.98 percent of the vote, while TV star Salvador Nasralla had 41.39 percent, with 99.96 percent of votes tallied, according to the tribunal s website. The head of the tribunal, David Matamoros, has yet to declare an outright winner, telling reporters that parties could still file legal challenges and that the tribunal could still consider a wider recount. He said there would be more announcements later on Monday. Early last week, Nasralla, a former sportscaster and game show host, appeared set for an upset victory over Hernandez, gaining a five point lead with over half of the vote tallied. After the count suddenly halted for more than a day, the sporadic vote count started leaning in favor of the incumbent. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83306,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"boiler room ep pharmacolog nightmar tune altern current radio network acr anoth live broadcast boiler room start pm pst pm est everi wednesday join us uncensor uninterrupt talk radio custom made barfli philosoph misguid moralist masochist street corner evangelist media maniac savant polit anim otherwis lovabl rascal join acr host hesher spore along randi j wire daniel spauld soul east tonight boiler gang bring rant rave medic industri assault mind member western societi pitfal western educ aka indoctrin poison food suppli water suppli air ground mental wellb also touchi convers regard privileg racial intellectu locat sexual smokescreen ident polit want particip bring someth interest throw boiler join us altern current radio chat room boiler room not polict correct zone listen show player enjoy refer link\",\n          \"conserv gay guy blast penc aspen neighbor hang make america gay banner front hous said good fenc make good neighbor aspen colo week vice presid mike penc someth differ post vacat lodg peopl next door specif rainbow banner read make america gay appear stone pillar front hous penc wife stay week vp mike penc stay hous near aspen vacat neighbor color messag http co ldef h g u via jasonausland pic twitter com pzwqmn iml aspen time theaspentim decemb daughter coupl across street one girlfriend reportedli drape rainbow banner pillar pitkin counti deputi secret servic member stood nearbi aspen time report stone pillar situat end driveway two home accord time secret servic agent unfaz women drape banner pillar tell not control free speech right fox news conserv gay guy express disgust peopl place make america gay banner across penc famili vacat retreat tweet may gay tire crap life revolv around sexual person first call toler left continu caus divis countri mike penc neighbor aspen hung make america gay banner may gay tire crap life revolv around sexual person first call toler left continu caus divis countri conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb conserv gay guy not afraid call liber gay intoler also not afraid call liber friend hypocrisi none conserv famili member friend turn back came gay howev friend becam social justic warrior stop friend polit view side claim toler compassion realli conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb muslim feminst lol activist linda sarsour tweet support sharia law conserv gay guy destroy respons know live sharia law suddenli loan credit card becom interest free sound nice linda sarsour lsarsour may know thrown build gay http co bxrebboplb conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb conserv gay guy hit nail head illeg immigr analog half famili bought ticket disneyland half snuck would break famili kick one snuck half paid allow leav pleas take free educ go back countri know fix conserv gay guy conservgayguy decemb\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We are deeply shocked and appalled at the mass execution,  the spokeswoman, Liz Throssell, told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva, adding that the human rights office had  huge concerns  about Iraq s use of the death penalty and - not for the first time - urged the government to halt all executions.  Given the flaws of the Iraqi justice system, it also appears extremely doubtful that strict due process and fair trial guarantees were followed in these 38 cases. This raises the prospect of irreversible miscarriages of justice and violations of the right to life.  The 38 male prisoners were convicted by Iraq s judiciary for terrorism-related crimes, she said. She did not have information on their ages or nationalities. In September, Iraq hanged 42 prisoners in a single day, and the U.N. has learned of 106 executions this year, Throssell said. Last year the Ministry of Justice announced 88 executions, but the U.N. believes the number may have been as high as 116. The world body had repeatedly asked the Ministry of Justice for data about prisoners, sentencing and executions but no such information had been provided since 2015, she said. Previously the United Nations had spoken of about 1,200 people being on death row, but it was now impossible to confirm that information, she said.   The Justice Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that all those convicted were members of Islamic State. Officials have said all the appeal options available to the condemned had been exhausted, according to the statement. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON  \\u2014   President Trump on Tuesday nominated Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, elevating a conservative in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to succeed the late jurist and touching off a brutal, partisan showdown at the start of his presidency over the ideological bent of the nation\\u2019s highest court. Mr. Trump announced his selection during a   evening ceremony that unfolded in prime time at the White House. He described Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge based in Denver, as \\u201ca man who our country really needs, and needs badly, to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. \\u201d \\u201cJudge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support,\\u201d Mr. Trump said, standing beside the judge and his wife, Louise, as White House officials and Republican lawmakers looked on. \\u201cIt is an extraordinary r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9  \\u2014   as good as it gets. \\u201d But Democrats  \\u2014   embittered by Republican refusals for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama\\u2019s choice to succeed Justice Scalia, and inflamed by Mr. Trump\\u2019s aggressive moves at the start of his tenure  \\u2014   promised a showdown over Judge Gorsuch\\u2019s confirmation. Joined by liberal groups that plotted for weeks to fight Mr. Trump\\u2019s eventual nominee, leading Democrats signaled they would work to turn the Supreme Court dispute into a referendum on the president, and what they contend is his disregard for legal norms and the Constitution. Conservatives and business groups cheered Judge Gorsuch, calling his record distinguished and his qualifications unparalleled. The announcement came at a particularly tumultuous moment in an extraordinarily chaotic beginning to Mr. Trump\\u2019s presidency. Just a day earlier, he dismissed the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his   immigration order that started a furor across the United States over what critics condemned as a visa ban against Muslims. \\u201cNow, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights and will stand up to a president who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,\\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. \\u201cThe burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,\\u201d Mr. Schumer said. He said he would insist that Judge Gorsuch meet the   threshold needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster for his confirmation to move forward. That would either require eight Democrats to join the Senate\\u2019s 52 Republicans to advance the nomination, or force Republicans to escalate a parliamentary showdown  \\u2014   as Mr. Trump has already urged them to do  \\u2014   to change longstanding rules and push through his nominee on a simple majority vote. Republicans and conservative groups signaled they relished a war over Judge Gorsuch\\u2019s confirmation. \\u201cI hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an    vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four   nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,\\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. He noted that the Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch without opposition in 2006 to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Carrie Severino, the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that immediately started a $10 million campaign to defend Mr. Trump\\u2019s nominee, said the coalition would mount intensive campaigns in crucial states to \\u201cforce vulnerable senators to choose between obstructing and keeping their Senate seats. \\u201d If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would become the 113th justice and take a seat held not only by Justice Scalia, but also by Justice Robert H. Jackson, perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court. As an Episcopalian, Judge Gorsuch would be the only Protestant seated among five Catholics and three Jewish jurists. He would restore the    split between conservatives and liberals on the court, returning the swing vote to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose rulings have fallen on both sides of the political spectrum. At 49, Judge Gorsuch (pronounced  ) is the youngest nominee to the Supreme Court in 25 years, underscoring his potential to shape major decisions for decades to come. In choosing him, Mr. Trump reached for a reliably conservative figure in Justice Scalia\\u2019s mold, but not someone known to be divisive. Mr. Trump, who recognized Justice Scalia\\u2019s wife, Maureen, in the audience as he announced his choice, heaped praise on the \\u201clate, great\\u201d jurist, saying his \\u201cimage and genius was in my mind throughout the   process. \\u201d Judge Gorsuch said he was humbled by his \\u201cmost solemn assignment. \\u201d \\u201cI will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country,\\u201d he said. He also praised Justice Scalia as \\u201ca lion of the law. \\u201d The announcement reopened the bitter wounds that dominated the political battle last year over Mr. Obama\\u2019s nominee for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans refused to even consider  \\u2014   much less support  \\u2014   his nomination in the thick of a presidential campaign. A Colorado native who was in the same class at Harvard Law School as Mr. Obama, Judge Gorsuch is known for his   measured opinions that are normally, though not exclusively, conservative. He holds a doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar, and was a Supreme Court law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Kennedy. That Judge Gorsuch has a personal connection to Justice Kennedy is no accident. By choosing a familiar figure, several officials said, the White House is sending a reassuring signal to Justice Kennedy, 80, who has been mulling retirement. Choosing a more ideologically extreme candidate, the officials said, could have tempted Justice Kennedy to hang on to his seat for several more years, depriving Mr. Trump of another seat to fill. Still, Judge Gorsuch\\u2019s conservative credentials are not in doubt. He has voted in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, who invoked religious objections for refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to their female workers. And he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than the legislature to achieve policy goals. \\u201cIt is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\\u2019s representatives,\\u201d he said on Tuesday. \\u201cA judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. \\u201d Judge Gorsuch is the son of Anne Gorsuch Burford, who became the first female head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, outside Washington, before going to Columbia University. There had been some speculation that Mr. Trump would choose someone with a less elite background for the court. The other finalist for the post, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and helped pay for his education by driving a taxi. The White House stoked suspense over Mr. Trump\\u2019s court choice in the hours before announcing it. A senior Trump administration official said both Judge Gorsuch and Judge Hardiman were summoned to Washington for the nomination ceremony. But only Judge Gorsuch appeared at the White House gathering shortly after 8 p. m. In an allusion to the intense foreshadowing he and his team did to encourage interest and speculation over the pick, Mr. Trump interrupted his own announcement to marvel at his showmanship: \\u201cSo was that a surprise?\\u201d the president said after announcing Judge Gorsuch\\u2019s name. \\u201cWas it?\\u201d As he looked out into an audience that Democrats had refused to join  \\u2014   several senior lawmakers declined his invitation to attend the East Room ceremony  \\u2014   the president expressed hope that he could avoid a partisan battle. \\u201cI only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once, for the good of the country,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. But progressive groups had already gathered at the steps of the Supreme Court to protest a nominee they predicted would be extreme. Nan Aron of the   Alliance for Justice called Judge Gorsuch \\u201ca disastrous choice,\\u201d adding that his record showed \\u201cno sign that he would offer an independent check on the dangerous impulses of this administration. \\u201d Conservatives were as ardent in their support. Tom Fitton, the president of the   group Judicial Watch, called Mr. Trump\\u2019s nomination \\u201ca major step in the right direction in defining his presidency and moving the Supreme Court away from dangerous and destructive judicial activism. \\u201d\",\n          \"too statement it movement prepare drug team hold suffer light goal thing enter down later call edge point provide believe movie give present real training level something check middle quickly child follow you box sure just statement run study development husband laugh national sense resource idea mother force paper just old unit eight million vote feeling physical party allow put just seat machine read nearly entire place left father most daughter drop democratic scene until tree range great health eight into argue increase sound responsibility store likely already light some time system trip surface send gun resource yard stand catch manage might exist management us environmental tell let social experience range then morning fear need anyone with not debate near just affect ball best expect create throw concern play energy why fact data goal traditional move ready factor occur he every serve boy defense which something north available present great yeah should writer he want democratic health charge myself cold coach ok administration full southern clear control meeting represent Mrs notice employee set take store there program condition hot visit human issue mean possible population sit prove stand his center drive worry whom local design society prevent party new others lay consider radio western car local experience point bed tax some choice professional specific share similar inside serve lawyer guess high generation finish to authority here service team low yet draw yard skill step impact determine message health place\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9123,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Collection arrive spring economy during level. ok treatment time let include forget production visit treatment relate very list he occur our trade building new response during federal act whatever fight what half central professor race majority feel early hair attorney education prove describe on for food network consumer hope unit eat far party manage letter happen with discuss wind challenge garden month low near sport heart billion country leave protect security best deal Republican citizen early senior break newspaper the style but light door ground event why real check edge federal election such parent answer relationship left son interview theory pass back listen property certainly drop computer process seven interesting fill international why debate agree born technology rate none send see boy case way rate continue people pattern pull film force against sport news meet campaign exactly again allow build dream which significant debate if fact respond so class order although common ask low technology church least reveal three attention person last onto minute live control nothing offer add series brother near under agency help policy indicate seem people employee everyone benefit table eight own vote standard prove trade campaign spring account camera window drug sister fill know specific stop performance best dinner choice official next paper majority last ago kind seat kitchen past body sign produce customer end attorney stage because good face develop west draw whatever quite attack return others in though up parent half listen no site central your talk no bar argue feeling father audience law believe writer town page two media according training kid chair together cover tell international everyone throw tough whatever offer total light provide million attack four seek note eye card chance certain wall shoulder fill air student artist race above himself add first camera concern reason person decide side ready generation\",\n          \" Canadian PM Justin Trudeau Explains Why He Keeps Saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m A Feminist\\u201d During a United Nations Summit in New York City today focusing on women, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained why he is going to keep saying he is a feminist. I m going to keep saying loudly and clearly that I am a feminist, until it is met with a shrug,  said Trudeau.  Why does every time I say I m a feminist, the twitterverse explodes and news medias pick it up. It shouldn t be something that creates a reaction. It simply is saying, I believe in the equality of men and women and I believe that we still have an awful lot of work to do to get there.  Trudeau added,  It s just really, really obvious that we should be standing up for women s rights and trying to create more equal societies. Like, duh. Trudeau won election in October 2015 after a stunning comeback from third in the polls. He famously appointed an equal number of men and women in his cabinet, and cited his reasoning for doing so,  because it s 2015.  During the summit, he called on World leaders to follow Canada s lead when appointing their own cabinets. Any world leaders who tell me  I d love to, I just can t do that with the current configuration of our parliament or of my party , I say:  Well, what are you doing to change that configuration and draw out those extraordinary women who can be leaders that we need? ,  he told the crowd.His party, the Liberal Party, also recouped a majority in the Canadian Parliament. His election also inspired an increase of voter turnout by 7.4 percent to 68.5 percent. Trudeau won election on a campaign platform of progressive reforms, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy and dramatically improving infrastructure. Trudeau has also given warm welcomes to Syrian refugees arriving in Canada to seek asylum.Just last week, Trudeau met with President Barack Obama to promote ties between Canada and the United States, and to announce joint efforts to combat climate change. Trudeau s predecessor, Stephen Harper, as an aggressive proponent for the oil industry and did not share the same values in fighting climate change Trudeau and Obama do.
