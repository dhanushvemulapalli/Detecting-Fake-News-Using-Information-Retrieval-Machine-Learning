# Detecting-Fake-News-Using-Information-Retrieval-Machine-Learning
In this project, I developed a fake news detection system that applies foundational IR preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, TF-IDF weighting, and n-gram feature modelling. These transformed raw news articles into structured numerical representations suitable for machine learning.
